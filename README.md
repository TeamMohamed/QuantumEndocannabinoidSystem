### 🔬 Overview:  
This repository secures the **Quantum Endocannabinoid System (ECS) framework**, integrating **CB1, CB2, GPCR signaling, cryptic cannabinoid pathways, and quantum bioenergetics.**  

The ECS isn’t just a modulator—it’s the **biological master regulator** of **immune response, metabolic adaptation, neural plasticity, and epigenetic control.**  

### 🔥 Why This Matters:  
✅ **First Quantum ECS Dataset** – Mapping **electron tunneling, proton spin, and vibrational states of cannabinoid signaling.**  
✅ **Cancer, Neurology & Metabolic Control** – **ECS-driven metabolic reprogramming in cancer, neurodegeneration, and energy homeostasis.**  
✅ **AI-Powered Cannabinoid Research** – **Integrating ECS with Quantum Medicine & AI-driven biological optimization.**  

### 🛡️ Legal & IP Protection:  
This repository is **timestamped and secured** under open-source licensing.  
- **Unauthorized commercial use without licensing is prohibited.**
